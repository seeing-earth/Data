## Enhance Efficiency

Electricity efficiency solutions include technologies and practices that reduce demand for electricity generation, literally lightening the load. The [two biggest end-users](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/) of electricity are buildings and industry, in roughly equal measure. While a home or factory may be the location of efficiency measures, these emissions get counted at the power plant where they are created or avoided, as part of the electricity sector. (See further exploration of buildings and industry below.)
